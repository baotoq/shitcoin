# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-05)

**Core value:** A working blockchain you built and understand end-to-end -- from transaction creation to block mining to peer synchronization.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Wallets and Transactions

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (Wallets and Transactions) -- IN PROGRESS
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase (02-02 complete)
Status: Executing Phase 2
Last activity: 2026-03-05 -- Plan 02-02 executed, transaction domain complete

Progress: [████████░░] 80%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 12min
- Total execution time: 0.8 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Core Chain Foundation | 2/2 | 32min | 16min |
| 2. Wallets and Transactions | 2/3 | 15min | 8min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (6min), 01-02 (26min), 02-01 (10min), 02-02 (5min)
- Trend: Steady velocity, clean domain packages completing quickly

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 02 P02 | 5min | 1 task | 8 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6-phase build order following hard dependency chains (hashing -> transactions -> mempool -> P2P -> dashboard -> extras)
- [Roadmap]: UTXO undo-log designed in Phase 2, consumed by Phase 4 reorg -- cannot be deferred
- [01-01]: JSON serialization for hashing (debuggable, deterministic via struct field order)
- [01-01]: Timestamp as int64 Unix seconds (not time.Time) to avoid precision issues
- [01-01]: GenesisMessage default via ApplyDefaults() method to avoid go vet struct tag warning
- [01-01]: MineWithMaxNonce added for testable nonce exhaustion
- [01-02]: Height index key format: 'h:' prefix + 8-byte big-endian for ordered bbolt iteration
- [01-02]: Copy byte slices inside bolt tx callbacks (bbolt pitfall #4)
- [01-02]: Demo config InitialDifficulty=5 for practical CPU mining demo
- [01-02]: go-zero stat/logx disabled in main.go for clean demo output
- [02-01]: btcec/v2 for secp256k1 ECDSA key generation (per user constraint)
- [02-01]: Hand-rolled Base58Check encoding for educational value (per user constraint)
- [02-01]: Atomic JSON file writes via temp file + rename for crash safety
- [02-02]: Hashable struct pattern for TX ID: JSON-serialize inputs (without sig/pubkey) and outputs, then DoubleSHA256
- [02-02]: Coinbase marker: zero hash + 0xFFFFFFFF vout (Bitcoin convention)
- [02-02]: Simplified SIGHASH_ALL: sign full transaction hash rather than per-input signing

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: UTXO reversibility data structure needs deeper design at start of Phase 2
- [Research]: Phase 4 (P2P) flagged for potential research-phase before planning
