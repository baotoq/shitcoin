# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-05)

**Core value:** A working blockchain you built and understand end-to-end -- from transaction creation to block mining to peer synchronization.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Core Chain Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Core Chain Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase (01-01 complete)
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-05 -- Plan 01-01 executed

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 8%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 6min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Core Chain Foundation | 1/2 | 6min | 6min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (6min)
- Trend: Starting

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6-phase build order following hard dependency chains (hashing -> transactions -> mempool -> P2P -> dashboard -> extras)
- [Roadmap]: UTXO undo-log designed in Phase 2, consumed by Phase 4 reorg -- cannot be deferred
- [01-01]: JSON serialization for hashing (debuggable, deterministic via struct field order)
- [01-01]: Timestamp as int64 Unix seconds (not time.Time) to avoid precision issues
- [01-01]: GenesisMessage default via ApplyDefaults() method to avoid go vet struct tag warning
- [01-01]: MineWithMaxNonce added for testable nonce exhaustion

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: UTXO reversibility data structure needs deeper design at start of Phase 2
- [Research]: Phase 4 (P2P) flagged for potential research-phase before planning
